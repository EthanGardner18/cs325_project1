And that’s why the Chiefs are moving on because Travis Kelce has stepped up to another level. And the same with the defense. It’s great for the game, man – just overall."

That Taylor bump is real now. I went to the concert. I got a 7-year-old daughter. And so it’s pretty cool." The Swift influence is definitely there.
