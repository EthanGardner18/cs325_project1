"Obviously, a bet of that size on a flip of a coin is substantial and rare. But we’ve had five-figure bets before." If the coin falls in favor of the bettor, it would pay out a profit of more than $95,000.  KRISTIN JUSZCZYK REVEALS 3-WORD MESSAGE UP HER SLEEVE AS 49ERS ADVANCE TO SUPER BOWL LVIII "It’s the Super Bowl. People love to bet all the crazy markets. Betting on a coin flip with that much money, it’s certainly interesting. But at least that customer will be invested early on. Hopefully for him, it’s ‘tails never fails,’" Pullen added. According to Caesars Sportsbook, the game opened with the 49ers as a two-point favorite, but within an hour, the early interest in the Chiefs shortened the spread to 49ers -1. Interestingly enough, the underdogs have covered the spread in 15 of the last 23 Super Bowls.
